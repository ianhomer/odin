# Mac OS

Install MidiMock as virtual keyboard and MIDI input device.  Then open 
**Audio MIDI Setup**, show the **MIDI Studio**, double click on **IAC Driver**
and ensure that two IAC Buses are provided.   In MidiMock set destination to
*ALL (act as Virtual Source)* and now the Odin sequencer should receive MIDI
in signals from MidiMock.
