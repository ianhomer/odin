# odin

Harmonising Chaos.

# Background

Maintains ingested environmental state and streams live patterns that can be experienced by our human senses.

The first milestone of this software will focus on driving live music performance via MIDI.  Out of this specific
use case will emerge an abstract concept to drive other outputs and consume other inputs.

# Example

Live music generated by environmental influences such as weather, knobs and keyboards.

# Build

    mvn package
    java -jar odin-server/target/odin-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

or run with developer benefits, e.g. web template reloading

    (cd odin-server && mvn spring-boot:run)

# Android Application

See also the [Odin Android App](https://github.com/ianhomer/odin-android).  

# Raspberry PI 

## Installation

Add "my.pi" domain name to /etc/hosts
        
On my.pi create .ssh directory 

    ssh pi@my.pi
    cd ~ && install -d -m 700 ~/.ssh

From **local machine** deploy SSH Key

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@my.pi 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

On my.pi

    sudo mkdir /opt/odin
    sudo chown pi /opt/odin
        
From **local machine** deploy jar 
        
    scp odin-server/target/odin-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar pi@my.pi:/opt/odin
      
On my.pi 
    
    ( cd /opt/odin ; java -jar odin-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar )

# Manual Testing

Run the MIDI playground script

    mvn exec:java

Lots of combinations and choice exist to generate and receive MIDI signals, for basics I use :

* A Korg microKEY to act as MIDI in signal.  Midi Mock (in Mac App Store) is a software keyboard that drives MIDI in
* Ableton Live as a receiver for MIDI out.

For performance I use a Nord Electro 5 and Nord Lead 4.
