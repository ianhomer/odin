# odin

Harmonising Chaos.

# Initial Use Case

Sequencer to generate sounds to accompany and in response from a live performance.

# Background

Maintains ingested environmental state and streams live patterns that can be experienced by our human senses.

The first milestone of this software will focus on driving live music performance via MIDI.  Out of this specific
use case will emerge an abstract concept to drive other outputs and consume other inputs.

# Build

    mvn package
    java -jar odin-server/target/odin-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

or run with developer benefits, e.g. web template reloading

    (cd odin-server && mvn spring-boot:run)

# Android Application

See also the [Odin Android App](https://github.com/ianhomer/odin-android).  

# Raspberry PI 

## Installation

Add "my.pi" domain name to /etc/hosts
        
On my.pi create .ssh directory 

    ssh pi@my.pi
    cd ~ && install -d -m 700 ~/.ssh

From **local machine** deploy SSH Key

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@my.pi 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

On my.pi

    sudo mkdir /opt/odin
    sudo chown pi /opt/odin
        
From **local machine** deploy jar 
        
    scp odin-server/target/odin-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar pi@my.pi:/opt/odin
      
On my.pi 
    
    ( cd /opt/odin ; java -jar odin-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar )    

# Access Server

Root

    http://localhost:8080/

Health check

    http://localhost:8080/health

# Manual Testing

Run the MIDI playground script

    mvn exec:java

Lots of combinations and choice exist to generate and receive MIDI signals, for basics I use :

* A Korg microKEY to act as MIDI in signal.  Midi Mock (in Mac App Store) is a software keyboard that drives MIDI in
* Ableton Live as a receiver for MIDI out.

For performance I use a Nord Electro 5 and Nord Lead 4.

# Static Code Analysis

## Sonar

    mvn clean verify sonar:sonar

## JavaScript

### Karma

    cd odin-server
    ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start karma.conf.ci.js

### ESlint

    ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js src/main/js/*.js
    
# Server Development with Hot Deployment

Start spring boot server

    cd odin-server
    mvn spring-boot:run&
  
After Code change, rebuild in IDEA with âŒ˜ fn-F9 and server will restart with new classes.

After react.js scripts change,

    mvn frontend:webpack
  
Stop spring boot server
  
    fg

And ctrl-c.
